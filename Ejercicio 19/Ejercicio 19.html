    <h2>I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed<br>
When the world gives you a raw deal<br>
Sets you off 'til you scream, "Piss off! Screw you!"<br>
When it talks to you like you don't belong<br>
Or tells you you're in the wrong field<br>
When something's in your mitochondrial<br>
Cause it latched on to you, like—</h2><br>
        
    <h2>Knock knock, let the devil in<br>
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'<br>
This medicine's screamin', "L-L-L-Let us in!"<br>
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe<br>
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago<br>
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'<br>
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent<br>
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa<br>
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants<br>
And blew up my-my-myself again<br>
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin<br>
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin<br>
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik<br>
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida<br>
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then<br>
Dr. Dre said, "Hell yeah!"<br>
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man<br>
And I know they're gonna hate<br>
But I don't care, I barely can wait<br>
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass<br>
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced<br>
Because they're gonna taste my, I´M VENOM</h2><br>
